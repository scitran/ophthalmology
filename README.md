Building up tools for Flywheel and ophthalmology data

Information about labeling requirements and how to login to the remote AO compute engine with the Dubra code are in info.

The test data on the Flywheel site are in VBR-CF and owned by scitran group.

One script sets the project.info labels

Another script reads the OCT2.mat data, converts them to NIfTI, and uploads back to the project.

The project description includes links to where the data were obtained and their metadata.  It also includes links to labeled OCT images for reference.
